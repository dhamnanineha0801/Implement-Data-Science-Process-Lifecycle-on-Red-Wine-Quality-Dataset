# Implement-Data-Science-Process-Lifecycle-on-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset

I carried out all the steps of Data Science Process Lifecycle on predicting the red wine quality.

The steps taken and questions answered are stated as following:
**Note : All the steps were validated by proper code** 

1. Analytic Approach
Q1. What is the analytical approach that you would take for this project? Why do you think its the right approach?

2. Data Requirements
Q2. What kind of data do we require for predicting the red wine quality and for determining the features that are the best quality red wine indicators?

3. Data Collection
Q3. From where do we get our data?

4. Data Understanding
Q4. From where are red wine samples obtained?
Q5. How can knowing the impact of each variable on the red wine quality help businesses(producers, distributors, etc) ?

5. Data Preparation
Explore the dataset further

- Check for missing values and handle if any
- Check for outliers if any and handle them
- Implement Correlation heatmap
- Check the distribution of data using histograms
- Prepare the data for modeling by carrying out any steps that you think are necessary

6. Modeling
Q6. Implement Multivariable Linear Regression using any 2 Regression algorithms of your choice

7. Model Evaluation
- Use three metrics: R-squared, RMSE, and MAE, to evaluate model prediction performance
- Compare these 3 metrics for the two models and analyze the performance
- Calculate the feature importance scores for the top features that help predicting wine quality and visualize them
